"""Each training step's skycap records, indexed in W&B.

skycap stores the records: each server writes a trajectory to its
``record_dir`` when it ends and, with ``skycap.record_mirror``, copies it to
remote storage. What only the trainer knows is which trajectories made up a
step, in which phase, and which of them trained. ``SkycapRecordIndex`` logs
that once per step, as one version of the W&B artifact
``skycap-records-<phase>-<run id>``, aliased ``<phase>-step-N`` and ``latest``:

- ``step.json``: the step's run index, as ``run_index.md`` (next to this file)
  specifies it: ``format_version``, ``run``, ``phase`` and ``step``,
  and a row per trajectory the generator opened during the step (every
  attempt, retries included) with its ``instance_id``, ``repetition_id``,
  ``attempt``, ``status``, the annotations it was finished with, whether a
  later attempt ``superseded`` it, whether it ``trained``, and its ``record``
  location from ``FinishResult.record`` (``path``, ``mirror``, ``files``).
- For a mirrored record, a reference entry ``records/<name>`` per file in its
  ``record.files``, to that file beside the mirrored document, added with
  ``checksum=False``: W&B stores the URI and neither reads the store nor
  copies bytes. A local-only record is in the index only.

Nothing here is Harbor's: any skycap generator that adds its trajectories to a
``RecordLog`` gets the index.

Logging fails open. The index is built on the trainer's thread, so a bug in it
raises into the step; the W&B calls run on a background thread, and W&B being
slow, down or erroring never fails a step. A call that overruns ``timeout`` is
abandoned with a warning and not retried (W&B may still create the version,
and a retry would log it twice). Errors that may pass are retried up to
``attempts`` times, but only before W&B accepted the version. The queue holds
``queue_size`` steps and drops new ones when full, and ``on_train_end`` waits up
to ``shutdown_timeout`` before the tracker finishes the run, then drops what is
left. Every loss is logged and counted in ``stats()``.
