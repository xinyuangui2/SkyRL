# Harbor through skycap

Harbor runs **unmodified, in text space**. Each trial's agent is pointed at its
own [skycap](../../../skycap) trajectory URL. skycap renders every prompt,
calls SkyRL's router with token ids, and records a context graph. Training gets
the exact tokens and logprobs the engine sampled, without Harbor knowing about
tokens.

The difference from the sibling [`harbor`](../harbor) integration: there Harbor
collects per-turn token ids itself (`collect_rollout_details`), which is why
summarization is banned. Here a rewritten history is a new branch of the
graph, so **summarization is allowed**. Each root-to-leaf path becomes one
training row, unless `skycap.train_paths` says otherwise (below).

## Running

```bash
uv run --isolated --extra fsdp --extra harbor --extra skycap \
  -m examples.train_integrations.harbor_skycap.entrypoints.main_harbor_skycap \
  trainer.policy.model.path=Qwen/Qwen3-8B \
  generator.inference_engine.served_model_name=policy \
  generator.step_wise_trajectories=true generator.merge_stepwise_output=false \
  trainer.algorithm.max_seq_len=32768 \
  data.train_data="['/path/to/harbor/tasks']"
```

The rest of the configuration is the sibling's: `harbor_trial_config` holds
Harbor's `TrialConfig`, with defaults from `../harbor/harbor_trial_config/default.yaml`.
`skycap.*` sets the record directory (default `{trainer.export_path}/skycap`),
the idle TTL, the port, the renderer pool size and which paths train.

## Which paths train

`skycap.train_paths` picks the rows of each rollout:

- `all` (default): every root-to-leaf path, each sampled message trained once.
  A reply the harness discarded and asked again for (mini-swe-agent on a format
  error) is a dead-end path, and trains with the rollout's advantage too.
- `final`: only the path to the reply of the rollout's last model call, the
  conversation the harness ended with. One row per rollout; nothing off it
  trains.
- `pkg.module:function`: a custom rule, a function of skycap's context graph to
  rows, each a path and the model nodes on it to train. skycap builds the
  tokens, loss masks and routes, and checks the rows. The module must be
  importable on every node, since each skycap server imports it at start. A
  rule that raises masks that rollout without retrying the trial.

For example, the final path plus every discarded reply under 64 sampled tokens,
each as a row of its own (`skycap.train_paths=my_rules:final_and_short_discards`):

```python
from skycap.graph import MessageGraph
from skycap.paths import Row, final_path

def final_and_short_discards(graph: MessageGraph) -> list[Row]:
    rows = final_path(graph)
    final = set(rows[0].path) if rows else set()
    for leaf in graph.leaves():
        tokens = graph.nodes[leaf].tokens
        if leaf not in final and graph.nodes[leaf].author == "model" and tokens is not None:
            if len(tokens.token_ids) - tokens.sampled_start < 64:
                rows.append(Row(graph.path_to(leaf), [leaf]))
    return rows
```

Every row of a trial carries its reward. See [skycap's README](../../../skycap/README.md#which-paths-train)
for what a rule may return.

## How it fits

| Piece | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `entrypoints/main_harbor_skycap.py` | Starts the skycap servers in token mode, in front of the router, from the run's config. Stops them at the end, which writes every trajectory still in memory. |
| `servers.py` | The server pool: one Ray actor per server, each running a `skycap.CaptureService` on a port of its own. skycap builds how calls reach the model from the options; the integration supplies only its engine wire. |
| `skyrl/backends/skyrl_train/inference_servers/skycap_engine.py` | `SkyRLEngine`, shared with the vision-language generator: skycap's vLLM wire on `/skyrl/v1/generate`, with packed routed experts and sampler support decoded by SkyRL's own `generate_wire`, and sessions released at `/finish_session`. |
| `harbor_generator.py` | Per trial: create a trajectory, point the agent's `api_base` at it, run Harbor, and `finish` with the reward to get the samples. A retry gets a fresh trajectory. |
| `compose.py` | Samples to a step-wise `GeneratorOutput`: a trial's paths are contiguous under its `TrajectoryID`, the last one marked `is_last_step` and carrying the reward. |

What's imposed on every call:
- **Sampling:** `generator.sampling_params` (`temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `min_p`), since the trainer computes logprobs with them.
- **`cache_salt`:** derived from the policy's weight version. It rides in the request body and skycap forwards it.
- **Session id:** the trajectory id, sent to the router as `X-Session-ID`.

Masking is the sibling's:
- **Timeout or failed rollout:** the whole instance is masked.
- **Context-length stop:** trains with reward 0, unless overlong filtering is on.
- **Failed inside skycap** (e.g. an unattributable prompt): the trial isn't trained on.

R3 (rollout routing replay) needs
`generator.inference_engine.enable_return_routed_experts=true` and
`trainer.policy.megatron_config.moe_enable_routing_replay=true`, with Megatron
and vLLM's `mp` backend, as for SkyRL's own generator. Each row carries routes
for its whole prompt and response, each from the forward pass that ran that
token. A trial whose trained path lacks routes is retried, then masked, and
counted in `generate/skycap/num_missing_route_trajectories`.

## Limits

- **Sampler support** (`enable_return_sample_support_set`) is passed through,
  padded to `top_k`.

## Tests

```bash
uv run --isolated --extra skyrl-train --extra harbor --extra skycap --extra dev pytest tests/integrations/harbor_skycap
```

A fake Harbor trial talks HTTP to a real skycap server, which calls a mock of
SkyRL's router. No GPU, sandbox or tokenizer download is needed.
