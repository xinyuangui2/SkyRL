"""A copy of every written record in a remote store, made in the background.

    mirror = RecordMirror("s3://bucket/run-7")
    mirror.submit(record_dir, "tr_ab12")    # after record.write; never blocks
    mirror.close()                          # at shutdown, bounded by a deadline

The local ``record_dir`` stays the source of truth: a record is written there
first, as always, and then queued for the mirror, which copies its files to
``{url}/{name}`` through fsspec, sidecars before the document. So a document
in the mirror has its sidecars beside it, as on disk.

``exclude`` leaves sidecar kinds out of the mirror, e.g. ``("experts",)`` when
the remote copy is for reading rather than retraining. The document is still
copied unchanged, so its manifest lists sidecars the mirror doesn't have; a
reader treats a listed sidecar that's missing as absent. The local record is
untouched. Excluding ``tokens`` is allowed, but a viewer reading the mirror
then has message text only.

The mirror fails open. A store that is slow, down or refusing never fails a
trajectory, it only loses the copy, and every loss is logged and counted in
``stats`` (served on ``/healthz``):

- The queue is bounded. A record that finds it full is dropped.
- Each file's copy has a timeout. A copy that overruns it is abandoned, not
  retried, since it may still land and a retry would write it twice.
- Errors that may pass (connection resets, timeouts, most ``OSError``) are
  retried, a bounded number of times with exponential backoff. Anything else
  fails the record at once.
- ``close`` waits for the queue until a deadline and drops what is left.

fsspec is imported only when a mirror is made (the ``remote`` extra). A store
other than the ones fsspec ships needs its implementation installed, e.g.
``s3fs`` for ``s3://`` or ``gcsfs`` for ``gs://``.
