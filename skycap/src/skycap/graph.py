"""The context graph: one trajectory's model calls as a forest of messages.

A node is one message and has one parent, so every root-to-leaf path is one
complete conversation and a shared prefix is stored once. Two children under
one parent are a fork: a resample, a subagent, a compaction, a harness edit.
None of those is special-cased; each is what the matching rule does with a
particular shape of input.

Every node carries two hashes, because two different questions get asked of it:

* ``match_hash`` -- "is this the message the request is sending?" It covers
  the message, the call's tool set and the model: what a harness can put in a
  request. Walking a request's history down the graph uses only this.
* ``delta_hash`` -- "is this the same node?" It is what ``add`` dedupes on,
  under a given parent. For a client-authored node it equals the match hash.
  For a model-authored node it also covers the author and the sampling params
  that shape the support, so the same output under a different ``top_p`` is a
  different sample, and a harness-written message never absorbs a sample that
  happens to equal it.

So author and sampling only decide whether a *new* node is created; they never
stop history from matching. A harness that replays the model's reply verbatim
matches the model node (by match hash) and continues from it: no branch. It
branches only if the replayed message differs, e.g. an edit or stripped
reasoning, and then the new node is client-authored.

Identical outputs under the same conditions are one node that records every
call that produced it. Rarely, several siblings share a match hash but differ
in delta: the same text sampled under two ``top_p`` values, a harness-written
message equal to a sample, or (token mode) the same text tokenized two ways.
A later request's matching message is then matched to the latest
model-authored one, or the latest client-authored one if there is no model
sibling. The others are ``shadowed_by`` it: still valid nodes whose paths train
normally. In text mode, history continues from the chosen sibling. In token
mode, a turn continues from it only if the turn reuses its tokens, and
otherwise from a client sibling with exactly the rendered tokens: a shadowed
one, or a new one. A shadowed model sample never continues (see
``skycap.tokens.turn``).

    ``text`` is what these tokens decode to, special tokens kept, and

    character that spans several tokens belongs to the token that completes it,

    Both are filled when the trajectory is recorded, so a reader never needs the
