"""A Cloudflare quick tunnel: a random public ``https://*.trycloudflare.com`` URL to a local one.

It needs no account and is gone when it stops. ``skycap.exposure.CloudflareQuickTunnel``
opens one per server, to the server's harness listener. The cloudflared binary
is taken from ``PATH``, or downloaded once from Cloudflare's releases (Linux).

cloudflared is tied to the process that started it (``spawn_tied``): it stops
when that process exits however it exits, a ``kill -9`` included, so a tunnel
never outlives its server.
