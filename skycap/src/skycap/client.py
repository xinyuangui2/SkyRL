Each trajectory lives on one server, and its ``base_url`` names that server,
so no router or load balancer is involved: the URL is the routing. Picking a
server is plain round-robin from a random starting point, which keeps several
independent pools (one per generator process) balanced without coordinating.
A server that can't be reached, or answers 5xx, is skipped for that create.
