"""Record this process's ``GPUModelRunner`` for receive-side sync hooks.

vLLM constructs ``WeightTransferEngine`` instances with the model, not the
worker or runner. SkyRL's receive-side finish hooks need the runner to repair
state that lives outside plain model weights, such as serialized-FP8 KV scale
mirrors. Record the process-local runner after ``GPUModelRunner.load_model`` so
engine hooks can find it later in the same worker process.
