"""Runtime opt-out for FlashAttention 4 in Transformer Engine.

SkyRL ships FA4 inside the combined ``flash-attn`` wheel, but only installs the
metadata-only ``flash-attn-4`` companion under the ``fa4`` extra, so FA4 is off
unless a user opts in (see the ``fa4`` extra in ``pyproject.toml``). This module
is the second half of that switch: a way to turn FA4 back off *without*
rebuilding the environment.

It flips ``FlashAttentionUtils.v4_is_installed``, which every FA4 branch in TE's
``get_attention_backend`` already consults -- including the final
``if use_flash_attention_4 and not FlashAttentionUtils.v4_is_installed`` -- so TE
falls back to FA2 (or cuDNN fused attention) through its own selection logic
rather than anything bolted on here.

Two uses:

* A/B-ing FA2 against FA4 on identical environments, where re-resolving the venv
  between arms would confound the comparison.
* An escape hatch if an FA4 kernel misbehaves on shapes or an architecture SkyRL
  exercises. TE 2.19's own arch gate excludes ``< sm90``, which covers the sm8x
  parts that used to pass TE 2.16's ``< sm80`` gate and then fail in the CuTe JIT
  with ``cudaErrorInvalidValue ... Target SM ARCH: unknown (unspecified)``
  (sm86/sm87/sm89: A10, L4, L40S, RTX 4090), so this is now about sm90+.
