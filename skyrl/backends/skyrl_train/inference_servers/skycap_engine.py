"""SkyRL's ``/skyrl/v1/generate``, as a skycap token-in/token-out engine.

It is vLLM's generate wire with three differences, all SkyRL's:

- the path, and a router that keeps per-session state, released at
  ``/finish_session`` when a trajectory ends;
- routed experts and sampler support come back as packed
  ``{data, shape, dtype}`` envelopes, decoded with the same functions
  ``RemoteInferenceClient`` uses, so the two readers can't drift;
- sampler support is asked for with ``return_sample_support`` and is padded
  with ``-1`` to ``top_k``.

skycap sends the trajectory id as ``X-Session-ID``, so the router's session and
the trajectory are the same one.

``/skyrl/v1/generate`` takes token ids only: it drops a request's multimodal
``features``. A run with images and no packed side channels uses vLLM's own
``/inference/v1/generate`` through the same router instead
(``packed_side_channels=False``), as ``RemoteInferenceClient`` does.
