    Serialized FP8 weight sync ships no KV/attention scale calibration, so 1.0
    is the wire's contract. vLLM 0.26 breaks it twice on this path:

    * ``CompressedTensorsKVCacheMethod.process_weights_after_loading`` copies the
      boot placeholders verbatim (no "<0 => default 1.0" branch like the base
      class), so ``load_format=dummy`` random init becomes the live scales and
      ``*_float`` mirrors from the first token.
    * After a level-2 sleep, ``GPUModelRunner.init_fp8_kv_scales`` resets only
      the ``_k_scale``/``_v_scale`` tensors; ``_q_scale`` wakes as 0.0 and every
      float mirror keeps its garbage. FlashInfer feeds
      ``bmm1_scale *= _q_scale_float * _k_scale_float`` from exactly those.

    Measured on Qwen3.5-0.8B (fp8_e4m3 KV): quantized-Q path generates NaN
    (``_q_scale`` = 0), bf16-Q path generates finite garbage (mean logprob diff
    1.33 vs the 0.05 bar) from ``_k_scale_float`` = -0.000745. Returns the
