# Inference

For training-to-inference weight transfer (`NewInferenceWorkerWrap`, broadcast vs. CUDA IPC, lifecycle), see [`weight_sync.md`](weight_sync.md).

## Architecture

- Key abstractions: `RemoteInferenceClient` , `ServerGroup`, `VLLMServerActor`, `VLLMRouter`
- `RemoteInferenceClient` interacts with HTTP endpoints: 
    - **Data plane**: Interact with router for completions requests.
    - **Control plane**: Fan-out to individual server URLs for weight sync, pause/resume.
- Shared inference interfaces and types live in `inference_servers/base.py` (`InferenceEngineInterface`, `InferenceEngineInput`/`Output`, `ConversationType`); shared helpers (`build_engine_runtime_env`, `get_sampling_params_for_backend`) live in `inference_servers/engine_utils.py`.

## vLLM Router

- `VLLMRouter` in `skyrl/backends/skyrl_train/inference_servers/vllm_router.py` wraps a child process running `vllm-router`. 

## PD Disaggregation

Prefill-Decode disaggregation:
- **Config**: `enable_pd=true` and `num_prefill` (decode engines = `num_engines - num_prefill`). Requires a
  `kv_transfer_config` with a supported P2P transfer connector (see below).
- **Server groups**: Separate prefill and decode `ServerGroup`s, one per engine.
- **P2P transfer connectors** (`get_pd_p2p_connector_name` in `inference_servers/utils.py`): two flavors are
  supported, either bare or wrapped in a vLLM `MultiConnector` (alongside store connectors such as
  `MooncakeStoreConnector` for KV offloading):
    - `NixlConnector` — pull-based default (NIXL side channel).
    - `MooncakeConnector` — push-based (bootstrap-server handshake). The router runs in `kv_connector=mooncake` mode and
      is given each prefill server's mooncake bootstrap server port. The `MultiKVConnectorPromMetrics.observe` monkeypatch
      (`patches/vllm/patch_multi_connector_stats.py`) is applied to avoid an assert-crash when a child connector
      reports stats without Prometheus metrics.
- **Role-specific engine kwargs**: `prefill_init_kwargs` and `decode_init_kwargs` are per-role pass-through vLLM engine
  kwargs (e.g. a different `all2all_backend`, or per-role `kv_role`) applied on top of the base args by
  `get_pd_cli_args`. They are **mutually exclusive** with `engine_init_kwargs` and require `enable_pd=true`; when used,
  both must be set and each must carry its own `kv_transfer_config` (enforced in `validate_inference_engine_cfg`).
- **Troubleshooting — configuring Mooncake GPU memory registration.** `WITH_NVIDIA_PEERMEM` selects how Mooncake pins
  KV-cache GPU memory. Decide with:

  ```
  lsmod | grep nvidia_peermem                          # is peer-memory available?
  cat /sys/class/infiniband/*/ports/1/link_layer       # InfiniBand | Ethernet (= RoCE)
  ```

  1. **`nvidia_peermem` loaded** (IB or RoCE alike) → leave the default. Mooncake registers via `ibv_reg_mr()`.
  2. **`nvidia_peermem` absent or unloadable** — module not shipped, or the container lacks `CAP_SYS_MODULE`
     (e.g. GKE/COS nodes, driver 580+) → set **`WITH_NVIDIA_PEERMEM=0`** to use the dmabuf path
     (`cuMemGetHandleForAddressRange` + `ibv_reg_dmabuf_mr`). Requires a GPU/driver with dma-buf support.
  3. **Got it wrong?** Symptom is a *silent hang, not an error*: hundreds of
     `Failed to register memory ...: Bad address [14]` at engine startup, servers still report healthy, then the first
     request stalls forever with `Memory region not registered by any active device(s)`.


## Key Config Knobs

All under `generator.inference_engine.*`:
- `enforce_eager` (bool, default true): With `enforce_eager=false`, there can be more mismatch between inference logprobs and trainer logprobs. It is recommended to use off policy correction methods like Truncated Importance Sampling (see `docs/content/docs/algorithms/off_policy_correction.mdx` for details) to prevent logprobs drift. 
- `gpu_memory_utilization` (float, default 0.8)
- `max_num_batched_tokens` (int, default 8192)
- `max_num_seqs` (int, default 1024)
- `enable_prefix_caching` (bool, default true)
- `enable_chunked_prefill` (bool, default true)
- `distributed_executor_backend` ("ray" or "mp")
- `engine_init_kwargs` (dict, pass-through to vLLM EngineArgs)

## Placement
- Colocated: vLLM and training workers (FSDP/Megatron) are placed on the same set of GPUs. We offload/backload each component as needed. During weight syncing, model weights from vLLM as well as model weights from the training workers remain on GPU
- Non-colocated: vLLM and training workers (FSDP/Megatron) are placed on a different set of GPUs. This reduces the number of available GPUs per component by half, but is in fact the preferred setup for agentic RL with SkyRL. This is because non-colocated setups allow for asynchronous training, where training and inference can progress together. Inference is typically dominated by a long tail of stragglers, and is also typically the time consuming component, and thus using half the number of GPUs doesn't affect inference time for a batch as much.
- Reserved eval engines (`trainer.eval_dispatch.mode=reserved`): a second `create_inference_servers` group built by `skyrl/train/eval/reserved.py` in its own placement group, never handed to `init_weight_sync_state` (so outside weight sync). It loads each evaluated step's HF export through `NewInferenceWorkerWrap.skyrl_load_weights_from_path` over `/collective_rpc`. Its port base is `VLLM_START_PORT + num_engines * dp * SERVER_PORT_STRIDE`, past the training fleet's span: the DP master port derives from the base, so two groups sharing one would collide.
